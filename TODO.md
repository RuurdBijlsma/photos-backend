1. ✅ Make python server with endpoints for:
    * ✅ batch generate thumbnails
    * ✅ process single image to json data
2. ✅ HOW DOES PGVECTGOR WORK??? CHANGE TO NON -rs version???
3. Make tables (migrations) in loco for all data generated by process single imagke
    * ✅ make all sub tables
    * ✅ challenge: enable pgvecto-rs extension and create the vector columns and indices (probably just raw sql it)
    * ✅ Make visual-information-model
    * ✅ make image_data migration with data_url, width/height/format etc.
    * ✅ add references for users table
4. ✅ Fix clippy

    5. todo: check for thumbnails in find_unprocessed_photos
7. ✅ Reduce duplicate code in analyze_api and thumbnails_api
8. ✅ Improve error logging for errors in api.
9. put analyzed image in db

11. Make worker job:
    * check for unprocessed photos etc. ->
    * generate all thumbs for them ->
    * run a new job to process a new photo and put in db
12. after processing photos per user:
    * run recluster worker job
    * clean up dangling thumbnails, db entries, etc.
    * fill timezone gaps
13. add something like watchdog for rust, watch for new files in directory https://docs.rs/notify/latest/notify/
14. add random image + theme endpoint
