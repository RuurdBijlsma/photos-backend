1. ✅ Make python server with endpoints for:
    * ✅ batch generate thumbnails
    * ✅ process single image to json data
2. ✅ HOW DOES PGVECTGOR WORK??? CHANGE TO NON -rs version???
3. Make tables (migrations) in loco for all data generated by process single imagke
    * ✅ make all sub tables
    * ✅ challenge: enable pgvecto-rs extension and create the vector columns and indices (probably just raw sql it)
